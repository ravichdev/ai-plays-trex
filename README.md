# AI Plays Chrome Dino T-Rex game
The `getting-started` branch has the foundation for the T-Rex game with additional wrapper classes to allow running multiple T-Rex instances in a single game environment.

This is the starting point to build a neural network model along with a genetic algorithm to complete the AI agent that can play the T-Rex game.
